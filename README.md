## Project Purpose

- The purpose of this project was to mainly learn the GitHub work flow. From creating iueses and a branch then committing that branch and doing a pull request linking the issue to merge the local branch into the master and deleting the local. The app its self allowed you to preform CRUD along with a variety of listOf and numberOf methods. JUnit testing was done for everything and validation was done for certain fields being entered by the user.


## Getting Started with the Project

- The project was a success having learned a lot in the process. Keeping the code not too complex while learning the work flow in GitHub slowed you down to think clearly in a organised fashion. Learning how to use GitHub while building an app will pay off huge benifits for future projects. 

## Getting Help

- Refrencing w3schools for YAML persistence
